### InAppTranslation
InAppTranslation automatically translates Android Widgets' texts at runtime by the power of Data Binding + Google Translate.  
Just by replacing `android:text` tag with `app:localizeText`, your app starts showing the UI in the user's local language.

### Install
```groovy
compile 'com.goldrushcomputing.inapptranslation:inapptranslation:0.9.3'
```


### Set Google Translate API Key
InAppTranslation uses Google Translate. Get the api key from [https://cloud.google.com/translate/](https://cloud.google.com/translate/)  

Set the key in local.properties file as below.
```groovy
inapptranslation.google_translate_apikey="Your_Google_Translate_API_Key"
```
(Don't share the local.properties file on GitHub.)

### Prerequisite
If your project is not ready for Data Binding, please do so by following  
[Data Binding Library - Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html)  

### Use
Instead of using `android:text="Hello"`, use the tag below.
```java
app:localizeText="@{`Hello`}"
```


Here is an example of TextView using the tag.
```java
<TextView
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:localizeText="@{`Hello`}"/>
```

You can also specify string resource.
```java
<Button
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:localizeText="@{@string/start}"/>
```
`app:localizeText` tag supports
* TextView
* Button
* CheckBox
* RadioButton
* CheckedTextView
* EditText

For ToggleButton and Switch, use
```java
app:localizeTextOff="@{`Off`}"
app:localizeTextOn="@{`On`}"
```
which works like `android:textOff` and `android:textOn`.

For EditText's hint text, you can use below hint tag
```java
app:localizeHint="@{`Type your name`}"
```

### Work with Switch
Changing `textOff` and `textOn` property of Switch from Java code doesn't change the actual texts on the UI. It seems like [a bug](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19790440/can-not-change-switch-text-on-off-at-runtime) in Android.  
Due to this limitation, dynamically translated texts for Switch textOn/Off properties are not displayed. To workaround this, I've added a class called `IATSwitch`.  

To use this, first import IATSwitch by adding the code below in `<data></data>` section in your layout.xml file.
```xml
<import type="com.goldrushcomputing.inapptranslation.IATSwitch" />
```
Then, replace Switch with IATSwtich as below
```java
<com.goldrushcomputing.inapptranslation.IATSwitch
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:showText="true"
    app:localizeTextOff="@{`Off`}"
    app:localizeTextOn="@{`Active`}"/>
```



### How Translation Works
InAppTranslation library uses Google Translate api to translate texts.  
The source language is automatically inferred by Google Translate.  
InAppTranslation sets the target language to the user's phone language.

### Specify Language
In case you don't use English as your base language, there is a chance that Google Translate doesn't recognize the source language properly.  
To avoid that, you can specify the base language by yourself.  
Add below code in your custom Application class's onCreate method.  
(You may want to change "ja" part of the code below if your base language is not Japanese.)
```java
InAppTranslation.setSourceLanguage("ja"); //translate from Japanese
```

### Road Map
* Provide a method to simply get translation data in Java code, in order to support localizing dynamic content such as news
* Cache translation results for better performance
* Better collaborate with strings.xml - use strings.xml if translation already exists.
